## Todo List with React & TypeScript

This is a very simple todo list without styling. I just wanted to practice React with TypeScript and also revisit some core JavaScript concepts.

### Problems I encountered

- I was initially confused by some of the TypeScript syntax, but I believe it will get better as I continue coding and practicing.
- I struggled with implementing the "Completed" and "Uncompleted" buttons â€” I found myself repeating similar code across different components.
- Sometimes, I overthink things ðŸ¤¯

### What I like about using TypeScript

When writing code with TypeScript, I feel much clearer about the data types I'm working with, and I know exactly what type a function will return. This gives me more confidence while building features.
